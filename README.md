#H1 Project HTML / CSS
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

For this mini project, I deconstructed an existing Google search result's webpage and rebuilt it. The links do not go anywhere, the search box doesn't do anything when a query is submitted, other interactive elements are not present, and the style is not pixel perfect to the original. However, this project demonstrates how HTML elements can be accurately placed and styled using CSS.

I learned and practiced using git a little more effectively for version control. I also learned how to position css sprites. And I used Chrome's developer tools when needed to get insight into the styles present on Google's page (e.g. for colors and spacing).
